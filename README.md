Solo is a powerful Discord Bot used for Moderation, Server Statistics, Utility Commands and so on.

It features a Webinterface, with which Server Admins can make settings to the Bot on their Server. It is supposed to be an All-in-one Solution, featuring the best modules from Dyno, Carl, Mee6 etc.

### Setting up the bot
Our bot is ready-to-go so everything you have to do is clone it and setup the configfile!

To do so, open up the *botconfig.json* in *config* folder. There you can setup your desired prefix and token of your user.
