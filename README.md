Solo is a powerful Discord Bot used for Moderation, Server Statistics, Utility Commands and so on.

It features a Webinterface, with which Server Admins can make settings to the Bot on their Server. It is supposed to be an All-in-one Solution, featuring the best modules from Dyno, Carl, Mee6 etc.

### Setting up the bot
Our bot is ready-to-go, so everything you have to do is clone it and start it (as long as you have Node.js installed). Upon running the bot with `node .` in a command shell or using the provided .bat-file, it will ask you to provide your bot token on launch. This is a security measure, so that people don't accidentally paste their bot token when they create a new branch of this repo.

### Running the bot
To make the bot as user friendly as possible, we have created a batch file so you don't have to know any commands.
When you set everything up, just run the `start.bat` file and you should be online in no time.
